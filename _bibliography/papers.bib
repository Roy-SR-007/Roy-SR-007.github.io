  abstract={“DISTRIBUTING NEWSPAPERS IN THE MORNING…..NOBLE BUT MONOTONIC RIGHT?” , this is what newsboys start their day with. Classical Newsboy Problem accepts the monotonicity of the job of newsboys but offers great profits. In this practical situation; newsboys has a certain amount ofnewspapers with them; the demand(X) of newspapers being random. In the following problem proposed considering two cases: supply of newspapers- when it is same and random with respect to order quantity, we derive the optimal order quantity using the cost function for different probability distributions which the demand follows; by mean minimising technique and thus finding out total optimal cost.},

  abstract={The Classical Newsboy Problem deals mainly with mean minimizing solution to obtain the optimal order quantity. In this paper we would resort to some Alternative Optimality Criteria to obtain the optimal order quantity; namely: Minimization of Standard Deviation of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of Coefficient of Variation of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of Standard Deviation Penalized Mean of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of the Modal Cost, Minimization of the probability of the Cost Distribution exceeding a given high value. Considering two realistic situations: Supply is same and Supply varies with the order quantity; we discuss the above procedures briefly with derivations and Numerical Illustrations.},
