  abstract={“DISTRIBUTING NEWSPAPERS IN THE MORNING…..NOBLE BUT MONOTONIC RIGHT?” , this is what newsboys start their day with. Classical Newsboy Problem accepts the monotonicity of the job of newsboys but offers great profits. In this practical situation; newsboys has a certain amount ofnewspapers with them; the demand(X) of newspapers being random. In the following problem proposed considering two cases: supply of newspapers- when it is same and random with respect to order quantity, we derive the optimal order quantity using the cost function for different probability distributions which the demand follows; by mean minimising technique and thus finding out total optimal cost.},
