  abstract={“DISTRIBUTING NEWSPAPERS IN THE MORNING…..NOBLE BUT MONOTONIC RIGHT?” , this is what newsboys start their day with. Classical Newsboy Problem accepts the monotonicity of the job of newsboys but offers great profits. In this practical situation; newsboys has a certain amount ofnewspapers with them; the demand(X) of newspapers being random. In the following problem proposed considering two cases: supply of newspapers- when it is same and random with respect to order quantity, we derive the optimal order quantity using the cost function for different probability distributions which the demand follows; by mean minimising technique and thus finding out total optimal cost.},

  abstract={The Classical Newsboy Problem deals mainly with mean minimizing solution to obtain the optimal order quantity. In this paper we would resort to some Alternative Optimality Criteria to obtain the optimal order quantity; namely: Minimization of Standard Deviation of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of Coefficient of Variation of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of Standard Deviation Penalized Mean of the Cost Distribution, Minimization of the Modal Cost, Minimization of the probability of the Cost Distribution exceeding a given high value. Considering two realistic situations: Supply is same and Supply varies with the order quantity; we discuss the above procedures briefly with derivations and Numerical Illustrations.},

For Example, in case of a 2^2 experiment, the function would return, SS(A), SS(B) and SS(AB) by implementing the Yates’ Algorithm, i.e., the SS due to the 3 required Factorial Effects, among which two are the Main Effects and one is the First Order Interaction Effect. Note that, while entering the 'trt.combo' or the 'trt' vector as shown in the consecutive examples below, you have to maintain the same pattern and order of the assigned treatments following which you have entered the response variable values y.},

  note = {R package version 4.0.5},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {The gambler’s ruin problem is a classic example, which illustrates the application of one-dimensional Random Walks - a Stochastic Process. Simulation of a gambling game under the gambler’s ruin setup concerns to a gambler starting the game with an initial capital, where the probability of winning a particular round is ’p’. If the gambler wins the round, then 1 unit of money is added to the gambler’s existing capital and if the gambler loses a round, then 1 unit of money is deducted from the gambler’s existing capital. The game stops when the gambler reaches his desired amount of money or gets totally bankrupted (ruined), these two points are known as the absorbed states of the game, or equivalently absorbed states in the one-dimensional random walk. The function ’grp.gameplay()’ in the package simulates the above described game, where the simulation runs until one of the absorbed states are reached, i.e., simulating the game until the gambler reaches to 0 money, getting ruined or wins the desired or targeted amount, eventually winning the game.},
