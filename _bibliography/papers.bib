  abstract={Tackling air pollution has become of utmost importance since the last few decades. Different statistical as well as deep learning methods have been proposed till now, but seldom those have been used to forecast future long-term pollution trends. Forecasting long-term pollution trends into the future is highly important for government bodies around the globe as they help in the framing of efficient environmental policies. This paper presents a comparative study of various statistical and deep learning methods to forecast long-term pollution trends for the two most important categories of particulate matter (PM) which are PM2.5 and PM10. The study is based on Kolkata, a major city on the eastern side of India. The historical pollution data collected from government set-up monitoring stations in Kolkata are used to analyse the underlying patterns with the help of various time-series analysis techniques, which is then used to produce a forecast for the next two years using different statistical and deep learning methods. The findings reflect that statistical methods such as auto-regressive (AR), seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Holtâ€“Winters outperform deep learning methods such as stacked, bi-directional, auto-encoder and convolution long short-term memory networks based on the limited data available.},

  title={Hybrid Learning Model for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5
using Aerosol Optical Depth},

  abstract={Existence of several challenges and high cost in the development of monitoring infrastructure have become major reasons for data sparsity by statutory government agencies tasked to study pollution exposure in urban areas. To tackle this problem, the use of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from various satellite based instruments coupled with the usage of learning algorithms have become popular in recent times. This paper presents a novel four-staged approach using different statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods to develop a spatio-temporal hybrid model for temporal forecasting using data from existing stations along with satellite aerosol optical depth data for spatial interpolation. Experiments conducted on real-world data belonging to the cities of Kolkata, Bengaluru and Mumbai show that a consistent pattern is not followed in all the cities in all stages except in spatial interpolation where Random Forest Regression is found to surpass all other models used. While an encoder-decoder architecture based long short term memory networks (LSTM Auto-Encoder) method when used for temporal forecasting in the hybrid method outperforms others in Mumbai, a Random Forest Regression based method and a multi-layer perceptron based method outperforms similarly in Kolkata and Bengaluru respectively.},

  abstract={Rising real estate prices along with expensive maintenance costs, and lack of spares during times of instrument failure have become major issues for statutory bodies when dealing with real-time pollution monitoring stations.  As a possible solution to these problems, a novel class of hybrid spatio-temporal pollution forecasting networks which are a combination of various widely used temporal forecasting methods and spatial interpolation methods have been proposed in this paper. In addition, a novel multi-site Multi Layer Perception based Ensemble method, capable of improving accuracy by taking exogenous variables into account, has also been proposed. Experimental results based on the multi-site air pollution data of Beijing demonstrate that the proposed class of hybrid networks have been effective in predicting the pollution of unknown locations with great levels of accuracy.  Moreover, the proposed novel MLP Ensemble method for spatial interpolation has also been empirically shown to perform equivalently in comparison to commonly used spatial interpolation methods.},

  title={Improving Temporal Predictions through Time-Series Labeling using Matrix Profile and Motifs},
  author={Saha, Pratik and Nath, Pritthijit and Middya, Asif Iqbal and Roy, Sarbani},
  journal={Manuscript under review},
  year={2021},
  abstract={One of the most challenging tasks in time-series prediction is a model's capability to accurately learn the repeating granular trends in the data's structure to generate effective predictions. Traditionally specially tuned statistical models and deep-learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short term memory networks (LSTM) are used to tackle such problem of sequence modeling. However in practice, factors like inadequate parameters in case of statistical models, random weight initializations, and data inadequacy in case of deep learning models affect the resulting final predictions. As a possible solution to these known problems, this paper introduces a novel  method of time-series labeling (TSL) comprising a combination of encoding and decoding methodologies that not only takes into account the granular structure of a time-series data but also its underlying meta-learners for better predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the approach's effectiveness and capability of handling wide range of scenarios, comparisons are drawn first over different widely used statistical and deep-learning models and then applying TSL to each of them in order to showcase the resulting performance improvement when implemented over a wide variety of real-world datasets. The experimental findings reflect an average of 25% increase in overall performance when using TSL along with mostly similar performance of different combinations regardless of model complexity thereby proving its efficacy in predicting periodic data.},
