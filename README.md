### Structure and Technologies

- **HTML + CSS**: The site is built using raw HTML and CSS (no site generator like Jekyll or Hugo). Layout, animations, and styling are hand-coded for full control.

- **JavaScript**: Used for interactivity and animations where applicable. Some pages include small inline JS for behavior enhancements.

---

### Deployment

This site is automatically deployed via **GitHub Pages** from the `gh-pages` branch.  No build step or static site generator is used. The pages also has Google indexing via `robots.txt`, `sitemap-webiste.xml`, and `google97...html`.

### Updating and Reproducing Content

To update the site:
1. Edit the relevant HTML/CSS/JS files locally.
2. Add contents by uploading to required folders `./blog`, `./news`, `./projects`, `./publications`, `./resources`, and `./software`.
3. Push changes to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. GitHub automatically publishes the new version.
5. Make proper citations, if using this `gh-pages` template.
