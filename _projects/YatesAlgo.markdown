This is an R-Package which facilitates the determination of the *Sum of Squares* of the required \\(2^n - 1\\) *Factorial Effects* in a \\(2^n\\) symmetric *Factorial Experiment*. Note that, the Factorial Experiment being conducted can be a *CRD (Completely Randomized Design)*, *RBD (Randomized block Design)* or an *LSD (Latin Square Design)*. To know more about the package visit the package documentation on [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/package=YatesAlgo.FactorialExp.SR).
