The *Gambler’s Ruin Problem* is one of the most celebrated problems in the broad spectrum of theoretical as well as applied probability. The problem entails the implementation of Markov Chains & Random Walks, i.e., a pure demonstration of a stochastic process. This is an R-package developed to demonstrate the simulation of a game under the gambler’s ruin setup. To know more about the insights of the problem and the related package visit the package documentation on [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gamblers.ruin.gameplay).
