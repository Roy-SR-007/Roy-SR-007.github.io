It is quite amusing and surprising that how data can reveal facts about a particular phenomenon which is difficult for one to observe through bare eyes. Following the similar analogy, in this paper, data has been collected to analyse the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 to various extents. The Analysis is supported by basic Statistical tools and coding, to give a clear view of the ongoing situations in India due to the widespread of the virus. We have exploited every possible area, where COVID-19 has inflicted despoliation.

This project was completed under the humble guidance of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra, ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/). Working for almost more than 4 months on the project, the major areas of analysis and the queries targetted are as follows:

*	The analysis will help us to grasp a strong view over the entire scenario of COVID 19.
*	It will provide us with a clear understanding of the present situation of the disease and how it is affecting the World.
*	We will be able to draw conclusions about the behavioural pattern of the disease.
*	Visualization of the consequences incurred due to the ongoing pandemic is also a key aspect of this analysis.
*	The rate at which recoveries, deaths and new cases are occurring is also analysed.
*	The effect of COVID 19 on the gender of the victims.
*	A brief study on the most common symptoms of the aforesaid disease.
*	The effect of Lockdown/Quarantine as a solution/remedy to the ongoing scenario created by the pandemic- Was it at all useful?
*	The beginning of a new Academic Era - Online Education, almost a by-product of the pandemic.

Major perspectives and results have been presented majorly describing the above mentioned propositions. A special attention has been given to the fact that *how COVID-19 has affected the world of education?*. Data was colected from different undergraduate students and professors to host and organise a detailed analysis.
