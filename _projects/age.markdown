The primary aim of this analysis was to study the **technological behaviour** of individuals ageing *at least 60 years* and infer about their *future notions* and *mindset* towards the *usage of technology*.

The focus has also been on studying and analysing the future prospective of such individuals in this modern and advanced world driven by technological powers.

The data was collected from [Census](censusindia.gov.in), centralizing the population of study on the Indians, ageing at least 60 years. Some of the **key parameters** that were identified are as follows: 

* Educational Qualification & Degree.
* Economic Background
* India's Urbanisation.
* The mentality of the individuals, being treated as the population under study.
* Inter-Relationship between areas (Rural & Urban).

The approach which was undertaken is widely known as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, i.e., visualization of the imporatant parameters and factors influencing our aim of study.

The analysis was successfully completed once again under the supervision of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra, ASI, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/). To thoroughly glance through the study and inference that has been drawn, feel free to read the [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AGmEtII40x8OVZd5jrCNuJ6ZCvdQM1yN/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102070392430420715240&rtpof=true&sd=true).

It goes without saying that, the study has a prospective aim in itself, i.e., to facilitate any resources and records to undertake technological advancements and innovations for the elderly (60+ aged individuals).
