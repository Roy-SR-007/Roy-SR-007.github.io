The project was undertaken by a team of candidates, with [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra, ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/) acting as the head of the team. Myself, working with [Sreejit Chaudhuri, B.Eng IT, Jadavpur University]() and [Arka Mukherjee, B.A Economics, Jadavpur University](), over a stretch of 3 months, mainly focussed on developing and validating statistical models to achieve a fine optimization of the production process. The project was supervised jointly by Dr.Subhamoy Maitra and [Nagasubramanian Kothandaraman, Tata Electronics]() (**Comapany Supervisor**). 

Due to NDA issues, much could not be discussed and disclosed about the insights of the project and its corresponding progress. Whereas, the project mainly touches over the following skillsets, tools, objectives and methodologies:

* Data Engineering including Data Cleaning, Visualization and Crunching to extract important and significant insights about the ongoing process.
* Statistical Modeling and Computational Statistics closely related to Data Science and Machine Learning techniques.  
* Mathematical Formulations of the probelems and queries posed.
* Statistical Quality Control.
* An attempt to present an Economic avenue of the problem (specifically the process optimization).  

All the above methodoogies and techniques have been applied and implemented, primarily to optimize the process in order to obtain the required levels/indices of the target variables, moreover cost reduction was also a crucial (in fact one of the most important points) kept in mind during the analysis. It was a great and successful experience to work under the Quality Control Wing of Tata Electronics, where we as a team were able to provide useful and required optimizations.
