This page is dedicated to showcase the applications that I have been able to produce using the open source software : R, and also listing down some of my additions to the network of R packages.

### R Packages

In view of the results obtained during a (research) project or certain applications to theory, a source of documenting those is to wrap them in the form packages in R, for extensive use and implementation at a global level.

* `YatesAlgo.FactorialExp.SR`. [[CRAN LINK]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/YatesAlgo.FactorialExp.SR/index.html)
Determines the sum of squares of the \\(2^{n} - 1\\) factorial effects in a \\(2^{n}\\) factorial experiment using Yates' algorithm. It majorly provides a function to implement **Yates' Algorithm** to determine the factorial effects in a factorial experiment (in this case \\(2^{n}\\)), where the factorial experiment can be carried out using any of the designs including **CRD**, **RBD** or **LSD**.
