I have completed my graduation (*Bachelors of Science* [BSc.]) in *Statistics Honours* from [St.Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata](https://www.sxccal.edu/), [Department of Statistics](https://www.sxccal.edu/b-sc-statistics-department/), 2018 - 2021 batch.

I have previously worked under the Quality Control Wing of [Tata Electronics,Pvt Ltd.](https://www.tata.com/) as a [Summer Intern]() under the guidance of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra , ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/) and [Nagasubramanian Kothandaraman, Tata Electronics]() (**Company Supervisor**), being involved in a 3 months long project (*May - July, 2021*), entitled **Surface Finishing and Anodizing - Process Optimization using Data Analytics**, working under the broad area of *Process Optimization* using regular *Data Science tools* and methodologies concerning to *Statistical Quality Control*.

As a [Summer Intern]() at the [Applied Statistics Unit(ASU), Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://asu.isical.ac.in/) for consecutively 2 years (*2019 & 2020*), during my undergraduate days, I have worked under the humble guidance of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra , ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/), broadly under the area of *Statistical Data Handling*, *Data Science* and *Machine Learning*.

I am presently a [Core Member & Editor](https://probability-space.netlify.app/team/somjit/) at [Probability Space](https://probability-space.netlify.app/), a joint initiative taken by myself along with some of my seniors and batchmates, encouraging the mission and vision of uplifiting collaborative reasearch and real-world problem solving on Theoretical/Applied Probability and Statistics.

As a budding statistician, I take major interest in both theoretical as well as applied topics of statistics and probability. My research interest lies in the universal field of probability which includes *Stochastic Processes*, *Markov Chains*, *Random Walks*, etc. and I also find myself involved dealing with applied topics and conundrums related to *Bayesian Inference & Statistics*, *Design of Experiments*, *Models*, *Data Science & Machine Learning*, *Simulations & Computational Statistics*, etc.

At the [107th Indian Science Congress, 2020](http://www.sciencecongress.nic.in/), held at [University of Agriculutural Sciences, Bangalore](https://uasbangalore.edu.in/index.php/kannada-uas), I presented my research works (*poster presentation*) on **Situations of Random Supply in a Classical Newsboy Problem** and **Newsvendor Problem - Alternative Optimality Criteria**, concerning to the field of Theoretical and Applied Probability.

In addition to my academics and research activities, I spend a major amount of time in creating and developing [R-packages](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) and [Interactive Web Applications](https://www.axonn.co.uk/interactive-web-applications) using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I also like to actively participate in research activities that stretches beyond Statistics and Mathematics, i.e., having a taste for interdisciplinary research.

## News

#### 2021

* I would be joining the [Department of Statistics](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html), [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/) for Master of Science (MSc.) in Statistics Hons (2021 - 2023). 

* Currently working with **Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUB's)** - an interdisciplinary research in the field of **Quantum Cryptography**. Few of the recent involvements and ventures of the topic that I am interested in, are as follows:
  ** Approximation of MUB's (Mutually Unbiased Bases) using simulations through generation of random matrices in *Ginibre Ensemble*, i.e., generating *Random Unitary Matrices distributed with Haar Measure*.
  ** Entanglement in MUB's - Numerical Computation of Partial Traces in Bipartite & Multipartite systems, an application aimed at reducing time complexity.

## More

* Here is a [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-6QlDsIbkoRFLuLled6876b4McSQXrQ/view?usp=sharing), which comprises of different problems in *Statistics*, *Probability*, *Mathematics*, etc. which I keep on updating as and when required. This includes problems from IMS, Putnam, ISI and various other sources.

* [This](https://roysomjitsr.shinyapps.io/grp_simulator/) is an interactive web application developed through **R Shiny**, which simulates a gambling game under the **Gambler's Ruin** setup. It allows you to give inputs for the amount of money you have, the amount which you want to win and an option for playing an Unbiased (Fair) or a Biased game, accordingly performing the simulation, following the gambler's ruin setup and thereby feeding you with your resulted game trajectory.
