I am a freshman pursuing Master of Science (MSc.) in Statistics Hons. in [Department of Statistics](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html) at University of Calcutta. Before joining, University of Calcutta, I completed my graduation (BSc.) in Statistics Hons. from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sxccal.edu/b-sc-statistics-department/), St.Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata (2018-2021).

I take major interest in both theoretical as well as applied topics of Statistics and Probability. Few of the topics on which I have worked previously (both research and practical interest) includes, *Stochastic Processes*, *Random Walks*, *Markov Chains*, *Designs of Experiment* and the broad avenue of *Computational Statistics*. Along with *Machine Learning* and *Data Science*, I also work in one of the broad domains of *Quantum Cryptography* - *Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs)*.
