I have completed my graduation (*Bachelors of Science* [BSc.]) in *Statistics Honours* from [St.Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata](https://www.sxccal.edu/), [Department of Statistics](https://www.sxccal.edu/b-sc-statistics-department/), 2018 - 2021 batch. I am an incoming post-graduate (*Masters of Science* [MSc.]) candidate in *Statistics Honours* at [Department of Statistics, University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/), 2021 - 2023 batch.

I have previously worked under the Quality Control Wing of [Tata Electronics,Pvt Ltd.](https://www.tata.com/) as a [Summer Intern]() under the guidance of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra , ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/) and [Nagasubramanian Kothandaraman, Tata Electronics]() (**Comapany Supervisor**), being involved in a 3 months long project (*May - July, 2021*) entitled **Surface Finishing and Anodizing - Process Optimization using Data Analytics**, working under the broad area of *Process Optimization* using regular *Data Science tools* and methodologies concerning to *Statistical Quality Control*.

As a [Summer Intern]() at the [Applied Statistics Unit(ASU), Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://asu.isical.ac.in/) for consecutively 2 years (*2019 & 2020*), during my undergraduate days, I have worked under the humble guidance of [Dr.Subhamoy Maitra , ASU, ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/~subho/), broadly under the area of *Statistical Data Handling*, *Data Science* and *Machine Learning*.

I am presently a [Core Member & Editor](https://probability-space.netlify.app/team/somjit/) at [Probability Space](https://probability-space.netlify.app/), a joint initiative taken by myself along with some of my seniors and batchmates, encouraging the mission and vision of uplifiting collaborative reasearch and real-world problem solving, under the broad areas of Theoretical/Applied Probability and Statistics.

As a budding statistician, I take major interest in both theoretical as well as applied topics of statistics and probability. My research interest lies in the universal field of probability which includes *Stochastic Processes*, *Markov Chains*, *Random Walks*, etc. and I also find myself involved dealing with applied topics and conundrums related to *Bayesian Inference & Statistics*, *Design of Experiments*, *Models*, *Data Science & Machine Learning*, *Simulations & Computational Statistics*, etc.

At the [107th Indian Science Congress, 2020](http://www.sciencecongress.nic.in/), held at [University of Agriculutural Sciences, Bangalore](https://uasbangalore.edu.in/index.php/kannada-uas), I presented my research works (*poster presentation*) on **Situations of Random Supply in a Classical Newsboy Problem** and **Alternative Optimization Criteria in a Newsvendor Problem**, concerning to the field of Theoretical and Applied Probability.
